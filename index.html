        <p> Here is my <a href="https://salma-rodriguez.github.io/Securities-Experiment/">financial time series project</a>.</p>

        <p>This is a financial engineering training of my own.  This training was completed by December 2020. All programming exercises from Dan Stefanica's "A Primer for the Mathematics of Financial Engineering" were attempted using Julia and the R statistical programming system. The financial mathematics exercises are in my composition notebook.</p>
