        <p>This is a financial engineering training of my own. Here is my <a href="https://salma-rodriguez.github.io/Securities-Experiment/">financial time series project</a>. This training was completed by December 2020. All programming exercises from Dan Stefanica's "A Primer for the Mathematics of Financial Engineering" were attempted using Julia and the R statistical programming system. The financial mathematics exercises are in my composition notebook.</p>
